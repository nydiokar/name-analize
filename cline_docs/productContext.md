# Name Analysis Tool

## Purpose
This project exists to provide deep insights into names through multiple analysis methods:
- Numerological analysis (total and destiny numbers)
- Phonetic breakdown (soft/hard sounds, patterns)
- Frequency estimation (vibrational profile)

## Problem Solution
- Offers multi-dimensional name analysis without external dependencies
- Provides immediate, local analysis without API requirements
- Delivers structured, easy-to-understand results

## Expected Operation
1. User inputs a name through terminal interface
2. System analyzes name through three core methods
3. Outputs organized results showing:
   - Numerological values
   - Phonetic patterns
   - Frequency estimations
4. Results displayed clearly in terminal
